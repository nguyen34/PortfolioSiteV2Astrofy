Hi, everyone. Johnson here. Full-stack developer with over 5-6 years of experience and writing my first-ever blog post on my first-ever portfolio site that I've ever built and deployed. Never really did this can of stuff before (which is sad, if you were to think about it.) and I'm not the most eloquent with my words either to put it simply. That being said, it's never too late to try and learn new things so I'm gonna go ahead and speak my mind out and see where it goes from there.

First off, I want to give a huge thanks to Manual Ernesto and everyone who contributed to the Astrofy template to help me build this site in the first place. Saved me so much time getting the groundwork set up on my personal Portfolio page, especially as someone who doesn't believe in inventing the wheel twice.

Now, with this, I always wanted to keep my Portfolio page bare-bones, acting as only a central hub for potential employers and other peer developers to look into my work, my experiences, and the personal projects that I hope to continue on and finish to build up my personal porfolio on.

Honestly. I'm not really sure what I should be writing here on my own personal developer blog, whether it should be strictly developer stories or the most random thing, like a game I was playing recently. It's possible that this might be the only blog post I write on this page going forward since my motive isn't really to improve traffic on the site, only to act as a referral for anyone who wants to dive deeper into my developer projects, an 'online resume' if you will.

That being said, I'm someone who prefers to let actions do all the speaking so time for me to get back to work and continue expanding on my personal projects. For everyone who took the time to read this to the end, thank you for doing so and I look forward to see where things go from here.
